Hello Lia this is your Hackaton review. 
I really enjoyed your project and was sad to find that there was no more games. I enjoyed the tic tac toe and was able
to steal the cookiees from the panda. Really liked the first screen style. In the future you will be able to 
manage this variables from one file in to other in an easy way when using react.
Some of your features werent working completly correct like the 2 inputs to put the answers in the time html 
only was able to fill the number in one of them. if the idea is to only use one input so then the other need to go
beacuse is confusing.

There is also very well implementation of event listeners and DOM manipulation. Liked a lot the timer feature.
even if does not work 100% good. Keep working in this project that is a one that you can add to your prtfolio.

Congratulations you did a very good job.
